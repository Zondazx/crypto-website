        <p>
          A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by
          cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or
          double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based
          on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate
          network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that
          they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them
          theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

        <p>
          Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or
          group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began
          use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source
          software.

        <p>
          Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart
          contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the
          platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market
          capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum is the most actively used
          blockchain.

        <p>
          Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy
          Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system that
          is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin
          features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its
          logo and namesake.
